# Sir Lints-a-Lot

The honored Sir Lints-a-Lot of the Knights of the Round Table has arrived to check whether your code has unused variables or functions. 

If your code is pure and free of unused bits, you may pass. But if not, beware! For Sir Lints-a-Lot will unleash the Killer Rabbit of code reviews, and only the Holy Hand Grenade of Refactoring can save you.
